# Simple JSON Beautifier Swing Application

This project stemmed from the need to format JSON received from various requests.  As we all know, it's much easier to read a formatted JSON output rather than something garbled up.  This application allows you to paste your output into the top field, and get a clean output below.  

It is a rather simple application.  Just package into a jar, and you can run it as though it were a portable app.

You can also run it using:  java -jar beautifier.jar

(It is an executable JAR after all)

Though the simplest way to package is to open this in VS Code > Java Projects Pane > Export Jar Button
